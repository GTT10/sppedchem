!                   components at T.
!
!  TOUT:IN          This is a point at which a solution is desired.
!
!  INFO(N):IN       This is an integer array used to communicate details
!                   of how the solution is to be carried out, such as
!                   tolerance type, matrix structure, step size and
!                   order limits, and choice of nonlinear system method.
!                   N must be at least 20.
!
!  RTOL,ATOL:INOUT  These quantities represent absolute and relative
!                   error tolerances (on local error) which you provide
!                   to indicate how accurately you wish the solution to
!                   be computed.  You may choose them to be both scalars
!                   or else both arrays of length NEQ.
!
!  IDID:OUT         This integer scalar is an indicator reporting what
!                   the code did.  You must monitor this variable to
!                   decide what action to take next.
!

!                   code with needed storage space.
!
!  LRW:IN           The length of RWORK.
!
!  IWORK:WORK       An integer work array of length LIW which provides

!
!  RPAR,IPAR:IN     These are real and integer parameter arrays which
!                   you can use for communication between your calling
!                   program and the RES, JAC, and PSOL subroutines.
!
!  JAC:EXT          This is the name of a subroutine which you may
!                   provide (optionally) for calculating Jacobian
!                   (partial derivative) data involved in solving linear
!                   systems within DDASPK.
!
!  PSOL:EXT         This is the name of a subroutine which you must
!                   provide for solving linear systems if you selected
!                   a Krylov method.  The purpose of PSOL is to solve
!                   linear systems involving a left preconditioner P.
!
! *Overview
!
!  The DDASPK solver uses the backward differentiation formulas of
!  orders one through five to solve a system of the form G(t,y,y') = 0
!  for y = Y and y' = YPRIME.  Values for Y and YPRIME at the initial
!  time must be given as input.  These values should be consistent,
!  that is, if T, Y, YPRIME are the given initial values, they should
!  satisfy G(T,Y,YPRIME) = 0.  However, if consistent values are not
!  known, in many cases you can have DDASPK solve for them -- see INFO(11).
!  (This and other options are described in more detail below.)
!
!  Normally, DDASPK solves the system from T to TOUT.  It is easy to
!  continue the solution to get results at additional TOUT.  This is
!  the interval mode of operation.  Intermediate results can also be
!  obtained easily by specifying INFO(3).
!
!  On each step taken by DDASPK, a sequence of nonlinear algebraic
!  systems arises.  These are solved by one of two types of
!  methods:
!    * a Newton iteration with a direct method for the linear
!      systems involved (INFO(12) = 0), or sparse systems(INFO(12)=2)
!    * a Newton iteration with a preconditioned Krylov iterative
!      method for the linear systems involved (INFO(12) = 1).
!
!  The direct method choices are dense and band matrix solvers,
!  with either a user-supplied or an internal difference quotient
!  Jacobian matrix, as specified by INFO(5) and INFO(6).
!  In the band case, INFO(6) = 1, you must supply half-bandwidths
!  in IWORK(1) and IWORK(2).
!
!  The Krylov method is the Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES)
!  method, in either complete or incomplete form, and with
!  scaling and preconditioning.  The method is implemented
!  in an algorithm called SPIGMR.  Certain options in the Krylov
!  method case are specified by INFO(13) and INFO(15).
!
!  If the Krylov method is chosen, you may supply a pair of routines,
!  JAC and PSOL, to apply preconditioning to the linear system.
!  If the system is A*x = b, the matrix is A = dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME
!  (of order NEQ).  This system can then be preconditioned in the form
!  (P-inverse)*A*x = (P-inverse)*b, with left preconditioner P.
!  (DDASPK does not allow right preconditioning.)
!  Then the Krylov method is applied to this altered, but equivalent,
!  linear system, hopefully with much better performance than without
!  preconditioning.  (In addition, a diagonal scaling matrix based on
!  the tolerances is also introduced into the altered system.)
!
!  The JAC routine evaluates any data needed for solving systems
!  with coefficient matrix P, and PSOL carries out that solution.
!  In any case, in order to improve convergence, you should try to
!  make P approximate the matrix A as much as possible, while keeping
!  the system P*x = b reasonably easy and inexpensive to solve for x,
!  given a vector b.
!

! *Description
!
!------INPUT - WHAT TO DO ON THE FIRST CALL TO DDASPK-------------------
!
!
!  The first call of the code is defined to be the start of each new
!  problem.  Read through the descriptions of all the following items,
!  provide sufficient storage space for designated arrays, set
!  appropriate variables for the initialization of the problem, and
!  give information about how you want the problem to be solved.
!
!
!  RES -- Provide a subroutine of the form
!
!             SUBROUTINE RES (T, Y, YPRIME, CJ, DELTA, IRES, RPAR, IPAR)
!
!         to define the system of differential/algebraic
!         equations which is to be solved. For the given values
!         of T, Y and YPRIME, the subroutine should return
!         the residual of the differential/algebraic system
!             DELTA = G(T,Y,YPRIME)
!         DELTA is a vector of length NEQ which is output from RES.
!
!         Subroutine RES must not alter T, Y, YPRIME, or CJ.
!         You must declare the name RES in an EXTERNAL
!         statement in your program that calls DDASPK.
!         You must dimension Y, YPRIME, and DELTA in RES.
!
!         The input argument CJ can be ignored, or used to rescale
!         constraint equations in the system (see Ref. 2, p. 145).
!         Note: In this respect, DDASPK is not downward-compatible
!         with DDASSL, which does not have the RES argument CJ.
!
!         IRES is an integer flag which is always equal to zero
!         on input.  Subroutine RES should alter IRES only if it
!         encounters an illegal value of Y or a stop condition.
!         Set IRES = -1 if an input value is illegal, and DDASPK
!         will try to solve the problem without getting IRES = -1.
!         If IRES = -2, DDASPK will return control to the calling
!         program with IDID = -11.
!
!         RPAR and IPAR are real and integer parameter arrays which
!         you can use for communication between your calling program
!         and subroutine RES. They are not altered by DDASPK. If you
!         do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these parameters by treat-
!         ing them as dummy arguments. If you do choose to use them,
!         dimension them in your calling program and in RES as arrays
!         of appropriate length.
!
!  NEQ -- Set it to the number of equations in the system (NEQ .GE. 1).
!
!  T -- Set it to the initial point of the integration. (T must be
!       a variable.)
!
!  Y(*) -- Set this array to the initial values of the NEQ solution
!          components at the initial point.  You must dimension Y of
!          length at least NEQ in your calling program.
!
!  YPRIME(*) -- Set this array to the initial values of the NEQ first
!               derivatives of the solution components at the initial
!               point.  You must dimension YPRIME at least NEQ in your
!               calling program.
!
!  TOUT - Set it to the first point at which a solution is desired.
!         You cannot take TOUT = T.  Integration either forward in T
!         (TOUT .GT. T) or backward in T (TOUT .LT. T) is permitted.
!
!         The code advances the solution from T to TOUT using step
!         sizes which are automatically selected so as to achieve the
!         desired accuracy.  If you wish, the code will return with the
!         solution and its derivative at intermediate steps (the
!         intermediate-output mode) so that you can monitor them,
!         but you still must provide TOUT in accord with the basic
!         aim of the code.
!
!         The first step taken by the code is a critical one because
!         it must reflect how fast the solution changes near the
!         initial point.  The code automatically selects an initial
!         step size which is practically always suitable for the
!         problem.  By using the fact that the code will not step past
!         TOUT in the first step, you could, if necessary, restrict the
!         length of the initial step.
!
!         For some problems it may not be permissible to integrate
!         past a point TSTOP, because a discontinuity occurs there
!         or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond
!         TSTOP.  When you have declared a TSTOP point (see INFO(4)
!         and RWORK(1)), you have told the code not to integrate past
!         TSTOP.  In this case any tout beyond TSTOP is invalid input.
!
!  INFO(*) - Use the INFO array to give the code more details about
!            how you want your problem solved.  This array should be
!            dimensioned of length 20, though DDASPK uses only the
!            first 15 entries.  You must respond to all of the following
!            items, which are arranged as questions.  The simplest use
!            of DDASPK corresponds to setting all entries of INFO to 0.
!
!       INFO(1) - This parameter enables the code to initialize itself.
!              You must set it to indicate the start of every new
!              problem.
!
!          **** Is this the first call for this problem ...
!                yes - set INFO(1) = 0
!                 no - not applicable here.
!                      See below for continuation calls.  ****
!
!       INFO(2) - How much accuracy you want of your solution
!              is specified by the error tolerances RTOL and ATOL.
!              The simplest use is to take them both to be scalars.
!              To obtain more flexibility, they can both be arrays.
!              The code must be told your choice.
!
!          **** Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ...
!                yes - set INFO(2) = 0
!                      and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL
!                 no - set INFO(2) = 1
!                      and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL ****
!
!       INFO(3) - The code integrates from T in the direction of TOUT
!              by steps.  If you wish, it will return the computed
!              solution and derivative at the next intermediate step
!              (the intermediate-output mode) or TOUT, whichever comes
!              first.  This is a good way to proceed if you want to
!              see the behavior of the solution.  If you must have
!              solutions at a great many specific TOUT points, this
!              code will compute them efficiently.
!
!          **** Do you want the solution only at
!               TOUT (and not at the next intermediate step) ...
!                yes - set INFO(3) = 0
!                 no - set INFO(3) = 1 ****
!
!       INFO(4) - To handle solutions at a great many specific
!              values TOUT efficiently, this code may integrate past
!              TOUT and interpolate to obtain the result at TOUT.
!              Sometimes it is not possible to integrate beyond some
!              point TSTOP because the equation changes there or it is
!              not defined past TSTOP.  Then you must tell the code
!              this stop condition.
!
!           **** Can the integration be carried out without any
!                restrictions on the independent variable T ...
!                 yes - set INFO(4) = 0
!                  no - set INFO(4) = 1
!                       and define the stopping point TSTOP by
!                       setting RWORK(1) = TSTOP ****
!
!       INFO(5) - used only when INFO(12) = 0 (direct methods).
!              To solve differential/algebraic systems you may wish
!              to use a matrix of partial derivatives of the
!              system of differential equations.  If you do not
!              provide a subroutine to evaluate it analytically (see
!              description of the item JAC in the call list), it will
!              be approximated by numerical differencing in this code.
!              Although it is less trouble for you to have the code
!              compute partial derivatives by numerical differencing,
!              the solution will be more reliable if you provide the
!              derivatives via JAC.  Usually numerical differencing is
!              more costly than evaluating derivatives in JAC, but
!              sometimes it is not - this depends on your problem.
!
!           **** Do you want the code to evaluate the partial deriv-
!                atives automatically by numerical differences ...
!                 yes - set INFO(5) = 0
!                  no - set INFO(5) = 1
!                       and provide subroutine JAC for evaluating the
!                       matrix of partial derivatives ****
!
!       INFO(6) - used only when INFO(12) = 0 (direct methods).
!              DDASPK will perform much better if the matrix of
!              partial derivatives, dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME (here CJ is
!              a scalar determined by DDASPK), is banded and the code
!              is told this.  In this case, the storage needed will be
!              greatly reduced, numerical differencing will be performed
!              much cheaper, and a number of important algorithms will
!              execute much faster.  The differential equation is said
!              to have half-bandwidths ML (lower) and MU (upper) if
!              equation i involves only unknowns Y(j) with
!                             i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU .
!              For all i=1,2,...,NEQ.  Thus, ML and MU are the widths
!              of the lower and upper parts of the band, respectively,
!              with the main diagonal being excluded.  If you do not
!              indicate that the equation has a banded matrix of partial
!              derivatives the code works with a full matrix of NEQ**2
!              elements (stored in the conventional way).  Computations
!              with banded matrices cost less time and storage than with
!              full matrices if  2*ML+MU .lt. NEQ.  If you tell the
!              code that the matrix of partial derivatives has a banded
!              structure and you want to provide subroutine JAC to
!              compute the partial derivatives, then you must be careful
!              to store the elements of the matrix in the special form
!              indicated in the description of JAC.
!
!          **** Do you want to solve the problem using a full (dense)
!               matrix (and not a special banded structure) ...
!                yes - set INFO(6) = 0
!                 no - set INFO(6) = 1
!                       and provide the lower (ML) and upper (MU)
!                       bandwidths by setting
!                       IWORK(1)=ML
!                       IWORK(2)=MU ****
!
!       INFO(7) - You can specify a maximum (absolute value of)
!              stepsize, so that the code will avoid passing over very
!              large regions.
!
!          ****  Do you want the code to decide on its own the maximum
!                stepsize ...

!
!       INFO(8) -  Differential/algebraic problems may occasionally
!              suffer from severe scaling difficulties on the first
!              step.  If you know a great deal about the scaling of
!              your problem, you can help to alleviate this problem
!              by specifying an initial stepsize H0.

!                 iteration, as opposed to the incomplete form.
!              NRMAX = maximum number of restarts of the SPIGMR
!                 algorithm per nonlinear iteration.  The default is
!                 NRMAX = 5.
!              EPLI = convergence test constant in SPIGMR algorithm.
!                 The default is EPLI = 0.05.
!              Note that the length of RWORK depends on both MAXL
!              and KMP.  See the definition of LRW below.

!               The usage of DDASPK is simpler if PSOL can carry out
!               the solution without any prior calculation of data.
!               However, if some partial derivative data is to be
!               calculated in advance and used repeatedly in PSOL,
!               then you must supply a JAC routine to do this,
!               and set INFO(15) to indicate that JAC is to be called
!               for this purpose.  For example, P might be an

!              LSOFF  = flag to turn off the linesearch algorithm
!                 (LSOFF = 0 means linesearch is on, LSOFF = 1 means

!   RTOL, ATOL -- You must assign relative (RTOL) and absolute (ATOL)
!               error tolerances to tell the code how accurately you
!               want the solution to be computed.  They must be defined
!               as variables because the code may change them.
!               you have two choices --
!                     Both RTOL and ATOL are scalars (INFO(2) = 0), or
!                     both RTOL and ATOL are vectors (INFO(2) = 1).
!               In either case all components must be non-negative.
!
!               The tolerances are used by the code in a local error
!               test at each step which requires roughly that
!                        abs(local error in Y(i)) .le. EWT(i) ,
!               where EWT(i) = RTOL*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL is an error weight
!               quantity, for each vector component.
!               (More specifically, a root-mean-square norm is used to
!               measure the size of vectors, and the error test uses the
!               magnitude of the solution at the beginning of the step.)
!
!               The true (global) error is the difference between the
!               true solution of the initial value problem and the
!               computed approximation.  Practically all present day
!               codes, including this one, control the local error at
!               each step and do not even attempt to control the global
!               error directly.
!
!               Usually, but not always, the true accuracy of
!               the computed Y is comparable to the error tolerances.
!               This code will usually, but not always, deliver a more
!               accurate solution if you reduce the tolerances and
!               integrate again.  By comparing two such solutions you
!               can get a fairly reliable idea of the true error in the
!               solution at the larger tolerances.
!
!               Setting ATOL = 0. results in a pure relative error test
!               on that component.  Setting RTOL = 0. results in a pure
!               absolute error test on that component.  A mixed test
!               with non-zero RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a
!               relative error test when the solution component is
!               much bigger than ATOL and to an absolute error test
!               when the solution component is smaller than the
!               threshold ATOL.
!
!               The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an
!               accuracy unreasonable for the machine being used.  It
!               will advise you if you ask for too much accuracy and
!               inform you as to the maximum accuracy it believes
!               possible.

!
!  LIW -- Set it to the declared length of the IWORK array.  The

!
!  RPAR, IPAR -- These are arrays of double precision and integer type,
!             respectively, which are available for you to use
!             for communication between your program that calls
!             DDASPK and the RES subroutine (and the JAC and PSOL
!             subroutines).  They are not altered by DDASPK.
!             If you do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these
!             parameters by treating them as dummy arguments.
!             If you do choose to use them, dimension them in
!             your calling program and in RES (and in JAC and PSOL)
!             as arrays of appropriate length.
!
!  JAC -- This is the name of a routine that you may supply
!         (optionally) that relates to the Jacobian matrix of the
!         nonlinear system that the code must solve at each T step.
!         The role of JAC (and its call sequence) depends on whether
!         a direct (INFO(12) = 0) or Krylov (INFO(12) = 1) method
!         is selected.
!
!         **** INFO(12) = 0 (direct methods):
!           If you are letting the code generate partial derivatives
!           numerically (INFO(5) = 0), then JAC can be absent
!           (or perhaps a dummy routine to satisf1y the loader).
!           Otherwise you must supply a JAC routine to compute
!           the matrix A = dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME.  It must have
!           the form
!
!           SUBROUTINE JAC (T, Y, YPRIME, PD, CJ, RPAR, IPAR)
!
!           The JAC routine must dimension Y, YPRIME, and PD (and RPAR
!           and IPAR if used).  CJ is a scalar which is input to JAC.
!           For the given values of T, Y, and YPRIME, the JAC routine
!           must evaluate the nonzero elements of the matrix A, and
!           store these values in the array PD.  The elements of PD are
!           set to zero before each call to JAC, so that only nonzero
!           elements need to be defined.
!           The way you store the elements into the PD array depends
!           on the structure of the matrix indicated by INFO(6).
!           *** INFO(6) = 0 (full or dense matrix) ***
!               Give PD a first dimension of NEQ.  When you evaluate the
!               nonzero partial derivatives of equation i (i.e. of G(i))
!               with respect to component j (of Y and YPRIME), you must
!               store the element in PD according to
!                  PD(i,j) = dG(i)/dY(j) + CJ*dG(i)/dYPRIME(j).
!           *** INFO(6) = 1 (banded matrix with half-bandwidths ML, MU
!                            as described under INFO(6)) ***
!               Give PD a first dimension of 2*ML+MU+1.  When you
!               evaluate the nonzero partial derivatives of equation i
!               (i.e. of G(i)) with respect to component j (of Y and
!               YPRIME), you must store the element in PD according to
!                  IROW = i - j + ML + MU + 1
!                  PD(IROW,j) = dG(i)/dY(j) + CJ*dG(i)/dYPRIME(j).
!
!          **** INFO(12) = 1 (Krylov method):
!            If you are not calculating Jacobian data in advance for use
!            in PSOL (INFO(15) = 0), JAC can be absent (or perhaps a
!            dummy routine to satisfy the loader).  Otherwise, you may
!            supply a JAC routine to compute and preprocess any parts of
!            of the Jacobian matrix  A = dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME that are
!            involved in the preconditioner matrix P.
!            It is to have the form
!
!            SUBROUTINE JAC (RES, IRES, NEQ, T, Y, YPRIME, REWT, SAVR,
!                            WK, H, CJ, WP, IWP, IER, RPAR, IPAR)
!
!           The JAC routine must dimension Y, YPRIME, REWT, SAVR, WK,
!           and (if used) WP, IWP, RPAR, and IPAR.
!           The Y, YPRIME, and SAVR arrays contain the current values
!           of Y, YPRIME, and the residual G, respectively.
!           The array WK is work space of length NEQ.
!           H is the step size.  CJ is a scalar, input to JAC, that is
!           normally proportional to 1/H.  REWT is an array of
!           reciprocal error weights, 1/EWT(i), where EWT(i) is
!           RTOL*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL (unless you supplied routine DDAWTS
!           instead), for use in JAC if needed.  For example, if JAC
!           computes difference quotient approximations to partial
!           derivatives, the REWT array may be useful in setting the
!           increments used.  The JAC routine should do any
!           factorization operations called for, in preparation for
!           solving linear systems in PSOL.  The matrix P should
!           be an approximation to the Jacobian,
!           A = dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME.
!
!           WP and IWP are real and integer work arrays which you may
!           use for communication between your JAC routine and your
!           PSOL routine.  These may be used to store elements of the
!           preconditioner P, or related matrix data (such as factored
!           forms).  They are not altered by DDASPK.
!           If you do not need WP or IWP, ignore these parameters by
!           treating them as dummy arguments.  If you do use them,
!           dimension them appropriately in your JAC and PSOL routines.
!           See the PSOL description for instructions on setting
!           the lengths of WP and IWP.
!
!           On return, JAC should set the error flag IER as follows..
!             IER = 0    if JAC was successful,
!             IER .ne. 0 if JAC was unsuccessful (e.g. if Y or YPRIME
!                        was illegal, or a singular matrix is found).
!           (If IER .ne. 0, a smaller stepsize will be tried.)
!           IER = 0 on entry to JAC, so need be reset only on a failure.
!           If RES is used within JAC, then a nonzero value of IRES will
!           override any nonzero value of IER (see the RES description).
!
!         Regardless of the method type, subroutine JAC must not
!         alter T, Y(*), YPRIME(*), H, CJ, or REWT(*).
!         You must declare the name JAC in an EXTERNAL statement in
!         your program that calls DDASPK.
!
! PSOL --  This is the name of a routine you must supply if you have
!         selected a Krylov method (INFO(12) = 1) with preconditioning.
!         In the direct case (INFO(12) = 0), PSOL can be absent
!         (a dummy routine may have to be supplied to satisfy the
!         loader).  Otherwise, you must provide a PSOL routine to
!         solve linear systems arising from preconditioning.
!         When supplied with INFO(12) = 1, the PSOL routine is to
!         have the form
!
!         SUBROUTINE PSOL (NEQ, T, Y, YPRIME, SAVR, WK, CJ, WGHT,
!                          WP, IWP, B, EPLIN, IER, RPAR, IPAR)
!
!         The PSOL routine must solve linear systems of the form
!         P*x = b where P is the left preconditioner matrix.
!
!         The right-hand side vector b is in the B array on input, and
!         PSOL must return the solution vector x in B.
!         The Y, YPRIME, and SAVR arrays contain the current values
!         of Y, YPRIME, and the residual G, respectively.
!
!         Work space required by JAC and/or PSOL, and space for data to
!         be communicated from JAC to PSOL is made available in the form
!         of arrays WP and IWP, which are parts of the RWORK and IWORK
!         arrays, respectively.  The lengths of these real and integer
!         work spaces WP and IWP must be supplied in LENWP and LENIWP,
!         respectively, as follows..
!           IWORK(27) = LENWP = length of real work space WP
!           IWORK(28) = LENIWP = length of integer work space IWP.
!
!         WK is a work array of length NEQ for use by PSOL.
!         CJ is a scalar, input to PSOL, that is normally proportional
!         to 1/H (H = stepsize).  If the old value of CJ
!         (at the time of the last JAC call) is needed, it must have
!         been saved by JAC in WP.
!
!         WGHT is an array of weights, to be used if PSOL uses an
!         iterative method and performs a convergence test.  (In terms
!         of the argument REWT to JAC, WGHT is REWT/sqrt(NEQ).)
!         If PSOL uses an iterative method, it should use EPLIN
!         (a heuristic parameter) as the bound on the weighted norm of
!         the residual for the computed solution.  Specifically, the
!         residual vector R should satisfy
!              SQRT (SUM ( (R(i)*WGHT(i))**2 ) ) .le. EPLIN
!
!         PSOL must not alter NEQ, T, Y, YPRIME, SAVR, CJ, WGHT, EPLIN.
!
!         On return, PSOL should set the error flag IER as follows..
!           IER = 0 if PSOL was successful,
!           IER .lt. 0 if an unrecoverable error occurred, meaning
!                 control will be passed to the calling routine,
!           IER .gt. 0 if a recoverable error occurred, meaning that
!                 the step will be retried with the same step size
!                 but with a call to JAC to update necessary data,
!                 unless the Jacobian data is current, in which case
!                 the step will be retried with a smaller step size.
!           IER = 0 on entry to PSOL so need be reset only on a failure.
!
!         You must declare the name PSOL in an EXTERNAL statement in
!         your program that calls DDASPK.
!
!
!  OPTIONALLY REPLACEABLE SUBROUTINE:
!
!  DDASPK uses a weighted root-mean-square norm to measure the
!  size of various error vectors.  The weights used in this norm
!  are set in the following subroutine:
!
!    SUBROUTINE DDAWTS (NEQ, IWT, RTOL, ATOL, Y, EWT, RPAR, IPAR)
!    DIMENSION RTOL(*), ATOL(*), Y(*), EWT(*), RPAR(*), IPAR(*)
!
!  A DDAWTS routine has been included with DDASPK which sets the
!  weights according to
!    EWT(I) = RTOL*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL
!  in the case of scalar tolerances (IWT = 0) or
!    EWT(I) = RTOL(I)*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL(I)
!  in the case of array tolerances (IWT = 1).  (IWT is INFO(2).)
!  In some special cases, it may be appropriate for you to define
!  your own error weights by writing a subroutine DDAWTS to be
!  called instead of the version supplied.  However, this should
!  be attempted only after careful thought and consideration.
!  If you supply this routine, you may use the tolerances and Y
!  as appropriate, but do not overwrite these variables.  You
!  may also use RPAR and IPAR to communicate data as appropriate.
!  ***Note: Aside from the values of the weights, the choice of
!  norm used in DDASPK (weighted root-mean-square) is not subject
!  to replacement by the user.  In this respect, DDASPK is not
!  downward-compatible with the original DDASSL solver (in which
!  the norm routine was optionally user-replaceable).
!
!
!------OUTPUT - AFTER ANY RETURN FROM DDASPK----------------------------
!
!  The principal aim of the code is to return a computed solution at
!  T = TOUT, although it is also possible to obtain intermediate
!  results along the way.  To find out whether the code achieved its
!  goal or if the integration process was interrupted before the task
!  was completed, you must check the IDID parameter.
!
!
!   T -- The output value of T is the point to which the solution
!        was successfully advanced.
!
!   Y(*) -- contains the computed solution approximation at T.
!
!   YPRIME(*) -- contains the computed derivative approximation at T.

!
!           IDID = 2 -- the integration to TSTOP was successfully

!
!           IDID = -3 -- the local error test cannot be satisfied
!                     because you specified a zero component in ATOL
!                     and the corresponding computed solution component
!                     is zero.  Thus, a pure relative error test is

!------INPUT - WHAT TO DO TO CONTINUE THE INTEGRATION  -----------------
!              (CALLS AFTER THE FIRST)
!
!     This code is organized so that subsequent calls to continue the
!     integration involve little (if any) additional effort on your
!     part.  You must monitor the IDID parameter in order to determine
!     what to do next.
!
!     Recalling that the principal task of the code is to integrate
!     from T to TOUT (the interval mode), usually all you will need
!     to do is specify a new TOUT upon reaching the current TOUT.
!
!     Do not alter any quantity not specifically permitted below.  In
!     particular do not alter NEQ, T, Y(*), YPRIME(*), RWORK(*),
!     IWORK(*), or the differential equation in subroutine RES.  Any
!     such alteration constitutes a new problem and must be treated
!     as such, i.e. you must start afresh.
!
!     You cannot change from array to scalar error control or vice
!     versa (INFO(2)), but you can change the size of the entries of
!     RTOL or ATOL.  Increasing a tolerance makes the equation easier
!     to integrate.  Decreasing a tolerance will make the equation
!     harder to integrate and should generally be avoided.
!
!     You can switch from the intermediate-output mode to the
!     interval mode (INFO(3)) or vice versa at any time.
!
!     If it has been necessary to prevent the integration from going
!     past a point TSTOP (INFO(4), RWORK(1)), keep in mind that the
!     code will not integrate to any TOUT beyond the currently
!     specified TSTOP.  Once TSTOP has been reached, you must change
!     the value of TSTOP or set INFO(4) = 0.  You may change INFO(4)
!     or TSTOP at any time but you must supply the value of TSTOP in
!     RWORK(1) whenever you set INFO(4) = 1.
!
!     Do not change INFO(5), INFO(6), INFO(12-17) or their associated
!     IWORK/RWORK locations unless you are going to restart the code.
!
!                    *** FOLLOWING A COMPLETED TASK ***
!
!     If..
!     IDID = 1, call the code again to continue the integration
!                  another step in the direction of TOUT.
!
!     IDID = 2 or 3, define a new TOUT and call the code again.
!                  TOUT must be different from T.  You cannot change
!                  the direction of integration without restarting.
!
!     IDID = 4, reset INFO(11) = 0 and call the code again to begin
!                  the integration.  (If you leave INFO(11) > 0 and
!                  INFO(14) = 1, you may generate an infinite loop.)
!                  In this situation, the next call to DASPK is
!                  considered to be the first call for the problem,
!                  in that all initializations are done.
!
!                    *** FOLLOWING AN INTERRUPTED TASK ***
!
!     To show the code that you realize the task was interrupted and
!     that you want to continue, you must take appropriate action and
!     set INFO(1) = 1.
!
!     If..
!     IDID = -1, the code has taken about 500 steps.  If you want to
!                  continue, set INFO(1) = 1 and call the code again.
!                  An additional 500 steps will be allowed.
!
!
!     IDID = -2, the error tolerances RTOL, ATOL have been increased
!                  to values the code estimates appropriate for
!                  continuing.  You may want to change them yourself.
!                  If you are sure you want to continue with relaxed
!                  error tolerances, set INFO(1) = 1 and call the code
!                  again.
!
!     IDID = -3, a solution component is zero and you set the
!                  corresponding component of ATOL to zero.  If you
!                  are sure you want to continue, you must first alter
!                  the error criterion to use positive values of ATOL
!                  for those components corresponding to zero solution
!                  components, then set INFO(1) = 1 and call the code
!                  again.
!
!     IDID = -4  --- cannot occur with this code.
!
!     IDID = -5, your JAC routine failed with the Krylov method.  Check
!                  for errors in JAC and restart the integration.
!
!     IDID = -6, repeated error test failures occurred on the last
!                  attempted step in DDASPK.  A singularity in the
!                  solution may be present.  If you are absolutely
!                  certain you want to continue, you should restart
!                  the integration.  (Provide initial values of Y and
!                  YPRIME which are consistent.)
!
!     IDID = -7, repeated convergence test failures occurred on the last
!                  attempted step in DDASPK.  An inaccurate or ill-
!                  conditioned Jacobian or preconditioner may be the
!                  problem.  If you are absolutely certain you want
!                  to continue, you should restart the integration.
!
!
!     IDID = -8, the matrix of partial derivatives is singular, with
!                  the use of direct methods.  Some of your equations
!                  may be redundant.  DDASPK cannot solve the problem
!                  as stated.  It is possible that the redundant
!                  equations could be removed, and then DDASPK could
!                  solve the problem.  It is also possible that a
!                  solution to your problem either does not exist
!                  or is not unique.
!
!     IDID = -9, DDASPK had multiple convergence test failures, preceded
!                  by multiple error test failures, on the last
!                  attempted step.  It is possible that your problem is
!                  ill-posed and cannot be solved using this code.  Or,
!                  there may be a discontinuity or a singularity in the
!                  solution.  If you are absolutely certain you want to
!                  continue, you should restart the integration.
!
!     IDID = -10, DDASPK had multiple convergence test failures
!                  because IRES was equal to -1.  If you are
!                  absolutely certain you want to continue, you
!                  should restart the integration.
!
!     IDID = -11, there was an unrecoverable error (IRES = -2) from RES
!                  inside the nonlinear system solver.  Determine the
!                  cause before trying again.
!
!     IDID = -12, DDASPK failed to compute the initial Y and YPRIME
!                  vectors.  This could happen because the initial
!                  approximation to Y or YPRIME was not very good, or
!                  because no consistent values of these vectors exist.
!                  The problem could also be caused by an inaccurate or
!                  singular iteration matrix, or a poor preconditioner.
!
!     IDID = -13, there was an unrecoverable error encountered inside
!                  your PSOL routine.  Determine the cause before
!                  trying again.
!
!     IDID = -14, the Krylov linear system solver failed to achieve
!                  convergence.  This may be due to ill-conditioning
!                  in the iteration matrix, or a singularity in the
!                  preconditioner (if one is being used).
!                  Another possibility is that there is a better
!                  choice of Krylov parameters (see INFO(13)).
!                  Possibly the failure is caused by redundant equations
!                  in the system, or by inconsistent equations.
!                  In that case, reformulate the system to make it
!                  consistent and non-redundant.
!
!     IDID = -15,..,-32 --- Cannot occur with this code.
!
!                       *** FOLLOWING A TERMINATED TASK ***
!
!     If IDID = -33, you cannot continue the solution of this problem.
!                  An attempt to do so will result in your run being
!                  terminated.

!***DESCRIPTION
!
!     DDASIC is a driver routine to compute consistent initial values
!     for Y and YPRIME.  There are two different options:
!     Denoting the differential variables in Y by Y_d, and
!     the algebraic variables by Y_a, the problem solved is either:
!     1.  Given Y_d, calculate Y_a and Y_d', or
!     2.  Given Y', calculate Y.
!     In either case, initial values for the given components
!     are input, and initial guesses for the unknown components
!     must also be provided as input.
!
!     The external routine NLSIC solves the resulting nonlinear system.
!
!     The parameters represent
!
!     X  --        Independent variable.
!     Y  --        Solution vector at X.
!     YPRIME --    Derivative of solution vector.
!     NEQ --       Number of equations to be integrated.
!     ICOPT     -- Flag indicating initial condition option chosen.
!                    ICOPT = 1 for option 1 above.
!                    ICOPT = 2 for option 2.
!     ID        -- Array of dimension NEQ, which must be initialized
!                  if option 1 is chosen.
!                    ID(i) = +1 if Y_i is a differential variable,
!                    ID(i) = -1 if Y_i is an algebraic variable.
!     RES --       External user-supplied subroutine to evaluate the
!                  residual.  See RES description in DDASPK prologue.
!     JAC --       External user-supplied routine to update Jacobian
!                  or preconditioner information in the nonlinear solver
!                  (optional).  See JAC description in DDASPK prologue.
!     PSOL --      External user-supplied routine to solve
!                  a linear system using preconditioning.
!                  See PSOL in DDASPK prologue.
!     H --         Scaling factor in iteration matrix.  DDASIC may
!                  reduce H to achieve convergence.
!     WT --        Vector of weights for error criterion.
!     NIC --       Input number of initial condition calculation call
!                  (= 1 or 2).
!     IDID --      Completion code.  See IDID in DDASPK prologue.
!     RPAR,IPAR -- Real and integer parameter arrays that
!                  are used for communication between the
!                  calling program and external user routines.
!                  They are not altered by DNSK
!     PHI --       Work space for DDASIC of length at least 2*NEQ.
!     SAVR --      Work vector for DDASIC of length NEQ.
!     DELTA --     Work vector for DDASIC of length NEQ.
!     E --         Work vector for DDASIC of length NEQ.
!     YIC,YPIC --  Work vectors for DDASIC, each of length NEQ.
!     PWK --       Work vector for DDASIC of length NEQ.
!     WM,IWM --    Real and integer arrays storing
!                  information required by the linear solver.
!     EPCONI --    Test constant for Newton iteration convergence.
!     ICNFLG --    Flag showing whether constraints on Y are to apply.

!***DESCRIPTION
!
!     DLINSD uses a linesearch algorithm to calculate a new (Y,YPRIME)
!     pair (YNEW,YPNEW) such that
!
!     f(YNEW,YPNEW) .le. (1 - 2*ALPHA*RL)*f(Y,YPRIME) ,
!
!     where 0 < RL <= 1.  Here, f(y,y') is defined as
!
!      f(y,y') = (1/2)*norm( (J-inverse)*G(t,y,y') )**2 ,
!
!     where norm() is the weighted RMS vector norm, G is the DAE
!     system residual function, and J is the system iteration matrix
!     (Jacobian).
!
!     In addition to the parameters defined elsewhere, we have
!
!     P       -- Approximate Newton step used in backtracking.
!     PNRM    -- Weighted RMS norm of P.
!     LSOFF   -- Flag showing whether the linesearch algorithm is
!                to be invoked.  0 means do the linesearch, and
!                1 means turn off linesearch.
!     STPTOL  -- Tolerance used in calculating the minimum lambda
!                value allowed.
!     ICNFLG  -- Integer scalar.  If nonzero, then constraint violations
!                in the proposed new approximate solution will be
!                checked for, and the maximum step length will be
!                adjusted accordingly.
!     ICNSTR  -- Integer array of length NEQ containing flags for
!                checking constraints.
!     RLX     -- Real scalar restricting update size in DCNSTR.
!     YNEW    -- Array of length NEQ used to hold the new Y in
!                performing the linesearch.
!     YPNEW   -- Array of length NEQ used to hold the new YPRIME in
!                performing the linesearch.
!     Y       -- Array of length NEQ containing the new Y (i.e.,=YNEW).
!     YPRIME  -- Array of length NEQ containing the new YPRIME
!                (i.e.,=YPNEW).
!     FNRM    -- Real scalar containing SQRT(2*f(Y,YPRIME)) for the
!                current (Y,YPRIME) on input and output.
!     R       -- Work array of length NEQ, containing the scaled
!                residual (J-inverse)*G(t,y,y') on return.
!     IRET    -- Return flag.
!                IRET=0 means that a satisfactory (Y,YPRIME) was found.
!                IRET=1 means that the routine failed to find a new
!                       (Y,YPRIME) that was sufficiently distinct from
!                       the current (Y,YPRIME) pair.
!                IRET=2 means IRES .ne. 0 from RES.

!***DESCRIPTION
!
!     DNEDD solves a nonlinear system of
!     algebraic equations of the form
!     G(X,Y,YPRIME) = 0 for the unknown Y.
!
!     The method used is a modified Newton scheme.
!
!     The parameters represent
!
!     X         -- Independent variable.
!     Y         -- Solution vector.
!     YPRIME    -- Derivative of solution vector.
!     NEQ       -- Number of unknowns.
!     RES       -- External user-supplied subroutine
!                  to evaluate the residual.  See RES description
!                  in DDASPK prologue.
!     JACD      -- External user-supplied routine to evaluate the
!                  Jacobian.  See JAC description for the case
!                  INFO(12) = 0 in the DDASPK prologue.
!     PDUM      -- Dummy argument.
!     H         -- Appropriate step size for next step.
!     WT        -- Vector of weights for error criterion.
!     JSTART    -- Indicates first call to this routine.
!                  If JSTART = 0, then this is the first call,
!                  otherwise it is not.
!     IDID      -- Completion flag, output by DNEDD.
!                  See IDID description in DDASPK prologue.
!     RPAR,IPAR -- Real and integer arrays used for communication
!                  between the calling program and external user
!                  routines.  They are not altered within DASPK.
!     PHI       -- Array of divided differences used by
!                  DNEDD.  The length is NEQ*(K+1),where
!                  K is the maximum order.
!     GAMMA     -- Array used to predict Y and YPRIME.  The length
!                  is MAXORD+1 where MAXORD is the maximum order.
!     DUMSVR    -- Dummy argument.
!     DELTA     -- Work vector for NLS of length NEQ.
!     E         -- Error accumulation vector for NLS of length NEQ.
!     WM,IWM    -- Real and integer arrays storing
!                  matrix information such as the matrix
!                  of partial derivatives, permutation
!                  vector, and various other information.
!     CJ        -- Parameter always proportional to 1/H.
!     CJOLD     -- Saves the value of CJ as of the last call to DMATD.
!                  Accounts for changes in CJ needed to
!                  decide whether to call DMATD.
!     CJLAST    -- Previous value of CJ.
!     S         -- A scalar determined by the approximate rate
!                  of convergence of the Newton iteration and used
!                  in the convergence test for the Newton iteration.
!
!                  If RATE is defined to be an estimate of the
!                  rate of convergence of the Newton iteration,
!                  then S = RATE/(1.D0-RATE).
!
!                  The closer RATE is to 0., the faster the Newton
!                  iteration is converging; the closer RATE is to 1.,
!                  the slower the Newton iteration is converging.
!
!                  On the first Newton iteration with an up-dated
!                  preconditioner S = 100.D0, Thus the initial
!                  RATE of convergence is approximately 1.
!
!                  S is preserved from call to call so that the rate
!                  estimate from a previous step can be applied to
!                  the current step.

!                  JCALC =  0 ==> Jacobian matrix is up-to-date.
!                  JCALC =  1 ==> Jacobian matrix is out-dated,
!                                 but DMATD will not be called unless
!                                 JCALC is set to -1.
!     JFDUM     -- Dummy argument.
!     KP1       -- The current order(K) + 1;  updated across calls.
!     NONNEG    -- Flag to determine nonnegativity constraints.
!     NTYPE     -- Identification code for the NLS routine.
!                   0  ==> modified Newton; direct solver.
!     IERNLS    -- Error flag for nonlinear solver.
!                   0  ==> nonlinear solver converged.
!                   1  ==> recoverable error inside nonlinear solver.
!                  -1  ==> unrecoverable error inside nonlinear solver.
!
!     All variables with "DUM" in their names are dummy variables
!     which are not used in this routine.
!
!     Following is a list and description of local variables which
!     may not have an obvious usage.  They are listed in roughly the
!     order they occur in this subroutine.

!     f(YNEW,YPNEW) .le. (1 - 2*ALPHA*RL)*f(Y,YPRIME) +
!                          ALPHA*RL*RHOK*RHOK ,
!
!     where 0 < RL <= 1, and RHOK is the scaled preconditioned norm of
!     the final residual vector in the Krylov iteration.
!     Here, f(y,y') is defined as
!
!      f(y,y') = (1/2)*norm( (P-inverse)*G(t,y,y') )**2 ,
!
!     where norm() is the weighted RMS vector norm, G is the DAE
!     system residual function, and P is the preconditioner used
!     in the Krylov iteration.
!
!     In addition to the parameters defined elsewhere, we have
!

!     R       -- Work space length NEQ for residual vector.
!     IRET    -- Return flag.

!
!     DNEDK solves a nonlinear system of
!     algebraic equations of the form
!     G(X,Y,YPRIME) = 0 for the unknown Y.
!
!     The method used is a matrix-free Newton scheme.
!
!     The parameters represent
!     X         -- Independent variable.
!     Y         -- Solution vector at x.

!                  If JSTART = 0, then this is the first call,
!                  otherwise it is not.

!
!                  If RATE is defined to be an estimate of the

!
!                  The closer RATE is to 0., the faster the Newton
!                  iteration is converging; the closer RATE is to 1.,
!                  the slower the Newton iteration is converging.
!
!                  On the first Newton iteration with an up-dated
!                  preconditioner S = 100.D0, Thus the initial
!                  RATE of convergence is approximately 1.
!
!                  S is preserved from call to call so that the rate

!***DESCRIPTION
!
! DSLVK uses a restart algorithm and interfaces to DSPIGM for
! the solution of the linear system arising from a Newton iteration.
!
! In addition to variables described elsewhere,
! communication with DSLVK uses the following variables..
! WM    = Real work space containing data for the algorithm
!         (Krylov basis vectors, Hessenberg matrix, etc.).
! IWM   = Integer work space containing data for the algorithm.
! X     = The right-hand side vector on input, and the solution vector
!         on output, of length NEQ.
! IRES  = Error flag from RES.
! IERSL = Output flag ..
!         IERSL =  0 means no trouble occurred (or user RES routine
!                    returned IRES < 0)
!         IERSL =  1 means the iterative method failed to converge
!                    (DSPIGM returned IFLAG > 0.)
!         IERSL = -1 means there was a nonrecoverable error in the
!                    iterative solver, and an error exit will occur.

!***DESCRIPTION
!
! This routine solves the linear system A * Z = R using a scaled
! preconditioned version of the generalized minimum residual method.
! An initial guess of Z = 0 is assumed.
!
!      On entry
!
!          NEQ = Problem size, passed to PSOL.
!
!           TN = Current Value of T.
!
!            Y = Array Containing current dependent variable vector.
!
!       YPRIME = Array Containing current first derivative of Y.
!
!         SAVR = Array containing current value of G(T,Y,YPRIME).
!
!            R = The right hand side of the system A*Z = R.
!                R is also used as work space when computing
!                the final approximation and will therefore be
!                destroyed.
!                (R is the same as V(*,MAXL+1) in the call to DSPIGM.)
!
!         WGHT = The vector of length NEQ containing the nonzero
!                elements of the diagonal scaling matrix.
!
!         MAXL = The maximum allowable order of the matrix H.
!
!       MAXLP1 = MAXL + 1, used for dynamic dimensioning of HES.
!
!          KMP = The number of previous vectors the new vector, VNEW,
!                must be made orthogonal to.  (KMP .LE. MAXL.)
!
!        EPLIN = Tolerance on residuals R-A*Z in weighted rms norm.
!
!           CJ = Scalar proportional to current value of
!                1/(step size H).
!
!           WK = Real work array used by routine DATV and PSOL.
!
!           DL = Real work array used for calculation of the residual
!                norm RHO when the method is incomplete (KMP.LT.MAXL)
!                and/or when using restarting.
!
!           WP = Real work array used by preconditioner PSOL.
!
!          IWP = Integer work array used by preconditioner PSOL.
!
!         IRST = Method flag indicating if restarting is being
!                performed.  IRST .GT. 0 means restarting is active,
!                while IRST = 0 means restarting is not being used.
!
!        NRSTS = Counter for the number of restarts on the current
!                call to DSPIGM.  If NRSTS .GT. 0, then the residual
!                R is already scaled, and so scaling of R is not
!                necessary.
!
!
!      On Return
!
!         Z    = The final computed approximation to the solution
!                of the system A*Z = R.
!
!         LGMR = The number of iterations performed and
!                the current order of the upper Hessenberg
!                matrix HES.
!
!         NRE  = The number of calls to RES (i.e. DATV)
!
!         NPSL = The number of calls to PSOL.
!
!         V    = The neq by (LGMR+1) array containing the LGMR
!                orthogonal vectors V(*,1) to V(*,LGMR).
!
!         HES  = The upper triangular factor of the QR decomposition
!                of the (LGMR+1) by LGMR upper Hessenberg matrix whose
!                entries are the scaled inner-products of A*V(*,I)
!                and V(*,K).
!
!         Q    = Real array of length 2*MAXL containing the components
!                of the givens rotations used in the QR decomposition
!                of HES.  It is loaded in DHEQR and used in DHELS.
!
!         IRES = Error flag from RES.
!
!           DL = Scaled preconditioned residual,
!                (D-inverse)*(P-inverse)*(R-A*Z). Only loaded when
!                performing restarts of the Krylov iteration.
!
!         RHOK = Weighted norm of final preconditioned residual.
!
!        IFLAG = Integer error flag..
!                0 Means convergence in LGMR iterations, LGMR.LE.MAXL.
!                1 Means the convergence test did not pass in MAXL
!                  iterations, but the new residual norm (RHO) is
!                  .LT. the old residual norm (RNRM), and so Z is
!                  computed.
!                2 Means the convergence test did not pass in MAXL
!                  iterations, new residual norm (RHO) .GE. old residual
!                  norm (RNRM), and the initial guess, Z = 0, is
!                  returned.
!                3 Means there was a recoverable error in PSOL
!                  caused by the preconditioner being out of date.
!               -1 Means there was an unrecoverable error in PSOL.
